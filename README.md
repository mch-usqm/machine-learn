# machine-learn

The files in this repository include Jupyter Notebooks I created, with their corresponding data files, which I used to demonstrate 
Machine Learning and Data Mining methods using Python. 
The Jupyter Notebooks include the references to the origin of the datasets used in the analysis.
The datasets referenced  are also included in their original .csv formats.

**NOTE**: The Jupyter Notebooks 1-2 and 1-3 in this repository are quite large, which can produce a slowdown when trying to view the files.
